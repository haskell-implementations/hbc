		HBI  -- Interactive Haskell B 1.2
Commands:
    <expr> ;
	Evaluate and print the expression. If the expression is of
        type `Dialogue', it is executed.
    let { <decl> } ;
	Make the bindings in declarator and make them available in
	the rest of the session.  No evaluation of the bound objects
	is performed.  The usual offside rule applies here.
    <topdecl> ;
	Any top level declaration except <decl>.
    { <topdecl>; ... } ;
	As previous, but more than one mutually recursive declarations.
    load <string> ;
	Load a file.  The string specifies what should be loaded, it
	can have three forms:
	*.hs	load a .hs file.  This must be an ordinary Haskell B module.
	*.o	load .o and .hi files.  These files must be produced
		by compiling an ordinary Haskell B module with hbc.
	*	loads *.hs if it is newer than *.o, otherwise the *.o file.
    import <id> ;
	Load a .o file using the HBCINCPATH, used to load library stuff.
    source <string> ;
	Read commands from the given file.
    whatis <ident> ;
	Give information about the identifier.
    help ;
	Print some information about hbi.
    infix<X> <digit> <opr> ;
	Make a fixity declaration.
    quit ;
	Quit the system.

It is possible to interrupt the evalution of an expression by hitting
the interrupt key.
