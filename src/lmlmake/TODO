Document hbcmakehbc.


Minor bugs to fix:

lmlmk is not aware of the -o option, so checks the date of the wrong executable.

When several paths refer to the same source file, this file is compiled
only once, but the .o and .t file should still be accessible via all paths.

Fix problems with comments in LMLFLAGS defs in Makefiles
Fix potential problems with the precence of tab chars in source files

The out-of-date test for executable files test all object files. This is
quite unneccesary.

Enhancements:

Depencency graph cache, to avoid scanning source files that haven't changed
since the last recompilation.

Merge hbcmake and lmlmake into one program that also handles a user extensible
set of file types, in a way similar to make(1).
