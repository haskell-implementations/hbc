<h1>Lexical Structure</h1>

Gaps and & are allowed in Char constants.
<hr>

The string ``<tt>{-#</tt>'' starts annotations.  Unknown
or badly placed annotations may cause an error.
<hr>

Character and string literals may contain <A HREF="http://www.unicode.org">Unicode</A> characters.
Unicode is a 16 bit character encoding that encompasses most
of the alphabets in the world.  The first 256 characters of Unicode
are the ISO8859-1 characters (i.e. the normal Haskell character
set).
<p>
A Unicode character is written
as <tt>\uXXXX</tt>, where XXXX is exactly 4 hexadecimal digits
(i.e. exactly like Java).
<p>
Although hbc handles 16 bit characters correctly within a program
the I/O libraries are still 8 bit oriented.  The <A
HREF="hbc_library.html#Unicode">Unicode module</A> contains functions to
encode and decode various Unicode formats.
<p>
Example: <tt>"\u05d0\u05d1\u05d2"</tt> is a string with the first three characters
(alef, bet, and gimel) of the Hebrew alphabet.
<p>
The Unicode character extension is always turned on.
