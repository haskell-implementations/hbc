<h1>Compiler flags</h1>

<h3>Ordinary flags</h3>
<ul>
  <li>-c<br>
      Separate compilation flag.  Will produce a ``.o'' file
      only, without linking.
  <li>-D<var>name</var><br>
      Define a symbol (this flag is sent to the
      preprocessor).
  <li>-I<var>name</var><br>
      Search for include files in <var>name</var> (this flag is sent
      to the preprocessor).
  <li>-static<br>
      Link the resulting program statically.
  <li>-o <var>name</var><br>
      Name the executable file <var>name</var>.
  <li>-noflags<br>
      Generate a binary that does not decode any flags.
  <li>-S<br>
      Produce an assembly file only.  This file has suffix ``.s''.
  <li>-T<br>
      Produce code to enable runtime tracing.  For further information look a the
      section on runtime flags.
  <li>-O<br>
      Optimize the program for speed at the cost of longer compilation time and a bigger object file.
      See further below.
  <li>-p<br>
      Enable profiling with prof.
  <li>-pg<br>
      Enable profiling with gprof.  The information from gprof is difficult
      to interpret since the order in which functions are called with lazy evaluation
      is rather strange.
  <li>-ph<br>
      Enable heap profiling.  For further information look at the section on
      runtime flags.
  <li>-i<var>path</var><br>
      Prepend path to the include path.  If <var>path</var> is empty the include path is emptied.
      A leading ``%'' in a path component will insert the value of the ``HBCDIR'' environment variable.
  <li>-cpp<br>
  <li>-M<br>
      Enable preprocessing by the C preprocessor for Haskell.
  <li>-lmlx<br>
      Compile a program using the fudgets library.
      A shorthand for the flags ``-u LMLX -i%/lmlx'' and the arguments ``-lX11 -lXext'' to the linker.
  <li>-showheap<br>
      Link the program with the heap display code, use the ``-xc'' flag
      when running the program.
  <li>-noflags<br>
      Link the program so that with built-in flag decoding inhibited.
  <li>-u <var>sym</var><br>
  <li>-l<var>lib</var><br>
  <li>-s<br>
      Sent to the linker.
  <li>-v<br>
      Make the front end verbose.
</ul>
<p>
Compiler flags can also be given on the first line of a file
using the <tt>COMPILERFLAGS</tt> pragma.

<h3>Code generator related flags</h3>

The following subset of the flags that may be of interest to the user.
<ul>
  <li>-fauto-specialize<br>
      Do automatic specialization of functions within a module.
      An overloaded function is specialized to whatever particular types it is used at.
  <li>-fconctype<br>
      Compile conctypes.
  <li>-fno-eta-expand<br>
      Do not do the reverse eta-reduction to saturate applications.
  <li>-fno-evalupdunw<br>
      Do not use runtime system code to return the value of a variable.
  <li>-fpat-bin-update<br>
  <li>-fpbu<br>
      Use a space leak avoiding compilation of pattern bindings.
  <li>-fshow-top-types<br>
      Print the type of all top level definitions in a module, regardless if they are
      exported or not.  This output can be used with the shell script addsign to merge
      it into the source.  All of this is performed by the command
      ``<tt>hbcaddsign </tt><var>file</var>''.
      This flag can be combined with ``-f-no-Num-overload'' to remove numeric overloading
      from a program.
  <li>-fno-zap-redex<br>
      Do not overwrite the top application node when entering a function.
      This gives somewhat faster, but leakier, programs.
  <li>-finst-with-c-t<br>
      Follow the Haskell rule for how instance declarations are
      exported.
  <li>-flocal-quant<br>
      Allow locally quantified type variables in data type
      declarations.
  <li>-fno-syn-expand<br>
      Do not expand type synonyms as aggressively in the interface files.
</ul>


<h3>CPU specific flags</h3>
<ul>
  <li>-mfar-jump<br>
      Emit code that can do far jumps on the SPARC.  This may be necessary for code
      that is to be used in the interactive system since normal jumps can only
      jump 8 Mbytes.  
  <li>-mi486<br>
      Emit code which is (just slightly) better for 486 than 386.
  <li>-msparc8<br>
      Use the smul/sdiv instructions available on SPARC-8.
  <li>-msolaris<br>
      Adapt code generator to Solaris conventions.
  <li>-mlinux<br>
      Adapt code generator to Linux conventions.
  <li>-mPOWER<br>
      Use the POWER version of the PPC instruction set.
  <li>-mPowerPC<br>
      Use the PowerPC version of the PPC instruction set.
</ul>


<h3>Optimization</h3>
When the ``-O'' flag is used the following flags are in effect:
<tt>
-fauto-specialize,
-ffail-strict,
-ffast-gc-check,
-fno-pre-tuple-sel,
-fstrict-call,</tt> and
<tt>-ftest-eval</tt>.
<p>
If the program is linked with the ``-O'' flag it will also use the memory
more aggresively (at the expense of a small working set).

<h3>Linker messages</h3>
The linker may complain about undefined symbols.  Usually this means
that that you have forgotten to include some files during linking.  It
is usually possible to figure out the names of the functions by
looking at the symbols the linker complains about.
<p>

If any of the symbols ``_USE_none'', ``_USE_heap'', or ``_USE_time'' are
undefined it means that you have tried to mix files compiled with
different profiling options.
