<h1>Release notes</h1>
<h2>0.9999.0</h2>
HBC 0.9999.0 is the first relase of hbc that supports Haskell 1.3.
It is rather preliminary (as the Haskell 1.3 report is barely
available), and I expect a new version to appear rather soon
if there any problems.

<ul>
  <li> Supports full Haskell 1.3.
  <li> Extension: Allows local universal and existential quantifications
   vis data type declarations.
  <li> Extension: Calling C is possible with a ccall mechanism.
  <li> Many useful libraries included.
  <li> The interactive system can now load shared libraries so
   it works on more platforms again.
  <li> Code generator for HPPA.
  <li> And it still compiles Haskell 1.2, of course.  Use the -1.2 flag.
</ul>
<p>
<h2>0.9999.1</h2>
HBC 0.9999.1 is a bug fix and minor update release.  There are no new
features.
<ul>
  <li>
      HTML documentation included.
  <li>
      Several bug fixes relating to existential and universal
      quantification.
  <li>
      Fix some minor Prelude discrepancies.
  <li>
      Update the Haskell library to the <a href="http://haskell.cs.yale.edu/haskell-report/newlib/library.html">latest version</a> (dated July
      18).
  <li>
      Minor changes to make it compile on more platforms.
  <li>
      Several minor bug fixes.
</ul>

<h2>0.9999.2</h2>
There are two new features in this release:
<ul>
  <li>
      A Windows 95/NT version.  This is the real reason for
      a new release.  There is only a batch compiler and
      it uses the CYGWIN32 package.
  <li>
      Floating point printing is neater and faster.
</ul>

<h2>0.9999.3</h2>
Several minor (but irritating) bugs fixed.<p>
This is a source only release.
<ul>
  <li>
      Make binaries much smaller by splitting some libraries.
  <li>
      Handle newtype with a function RHS correctly.
  <li>
      Fix tyvar name capture problem in instance declarations.
  <li>
      Fix bug in typechecking of local universal quantification.
  <li>
      Even nicer printing of floats.
  <li>
      Module Trace is back!
  <li>
      State.sameVar works now.
</ul>

<h2>0.9999.3</h2>
Several minor (but irritating) bugs fixed.<p>
This is a source only release.
<ul>
  <li>
      A working fromRational (finally).
  <li>
      Some type checker bugs fixed.
  <li>
      Internal changes to the State library.
  <li>
      Timezone bug fix in Time.
</ul>

<h2>0.9999.4</h2>
This release follows the Haskell 1.4 definition.
<ul>
  <li>
      Initial implementation of views, as suggested by
      Burton, Wadler, et. al.
  <li>
      Time zones handled in a more sane way.
  <li>
      Yet another bug with local universal quantification and contexts
      fixed.
  <li>
      Allow a subset of the constructors/methods to be exported.
      Subset import is not yet implemented.
  <li>
      Expand list comprehension syntax to monads.
  <li>
      Update libraries to official version.
  <li>
      formatCalendarTime function similar to strftime(3) added to Time
      module.
  <li>
      Rudimentary Locale module added.
  <li>
      Deriving of Read now works for labelled fields.
  <li>
      The environment variable HBCDIR should now work.
  <li>
      The interactive system attempts to build shared objects
      ``.so'' from object files automatically.
  <li>
      Add module for catenable lists (i.e. O(1) append).
  <li>
      Add binary file modes.
  <li>
      Several minor bugs fixed.
</ul>
