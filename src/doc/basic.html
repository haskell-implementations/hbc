<h1>Basic types</h1>

Tuples are only supported up to a bounded size (currently 30).
<hr>
The normal instances (Eq, Ord, Read, Show, Ix) for tuples are only available
up to size 5.
<hr>
The class <tt>Num</tt> has a method <tt>fromInt</tt> to convert
from an <tt>Int</tt> to the type.
<hr>
The class <tt>Integral</tt> has the new method <tt>toInt</tt> to
convert from the type to an <tt>Int</tt>.
<hr>
The class <tt>Show</tt> has the new method <tt>showsType</tt> which
is similar to <tt>shows</tt>, but shows the type instead.  The default
method for <tt>showsPrec</tt> shows the type enclosed in ``<tt><< >></tt>''.
