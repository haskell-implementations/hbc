<h3>Binary I/O</h3>
Some systems (notably Windows 95 and Windows NT) differ in their
treatment of binary files and text files.  To make the use of binary
files easier hbc extend the IOMode type with modes for binaryfile.
The new IOMode type looks like this:
<pre>
    data IOMode = ReadMode
                | WriteMode
                | AppendMode 
                | ReadWriteMode
                | ReadBinaryMode       -- hbc extension
                | WriteBinaryMode      -- hbc extension
                | AppendBinaryMode     -- hbc extension
                | ReadWriteBinaryMode  -- hbc extension
</pre>


Hbc allows calling C directly from Haskell using the IO monad.

<h3>Easy ccall</h3>
To enable calling of C functions you need to compile with the
<tt>-fccall</tt> flag and import the <tt>CCall</tt> module.
This enables the language construct <tt>ccall</tt>.<p>
Calling C has the following form:
<pre>
  ccall cfunction e<sub>1</sub> ... e<sub>n</sub>
</pre>
The type of a such an expressions is <tt>(CValue a)=>a</tt> and
each of the <tt>e<sub>i</sub></tt> must also have this type.
There is no type checking of the C call so it is the responsiblity of
the user to ensure that all arguments and return values are used
properly.
<p>
The types <tt>Int, Double, Float, Bool, Char,</tt> and <tt>String</tt>
are all instances of the <tt>CValue</tt> class.
<p>
Example:
<pre>
  gammaIO :: Double -> IO Double
  gammaIO x = ccall lgamma x >>= return . exp
</pre>

<h3>Gory details</h3>
You can define new instances of the <tt>CValue</tt> class.  The class
declaration looks like this.
<pre>
class CValue a where
    toCU :: a -> CUnion
    fromCU :: CUnion -> a
</pre>
The <tt>CUnion</tt> is used to encode the values used during the C
call.
<pre>
  data CUnion = _CUInt Int
              | _CUDouble Double 
              | _CUString String 
              | _CUPointer CPointer
              | _CUByteVector _ByteVector._ByteVector
</pre>
The <tt>CPointer</tt> is used for pointer valued argument/results in C
calls.  There are some operations available on them:
<pre>
  nullCPointer :: CPointer
  addCPointer :: CPointer -> Int -> CPointer
</pre>
There are also two language construct that yield <tt>CPointer</tt>
values:
<pre>
  cFunction <i>cfunctionname</i>
  cVariable <i>cvariablename</i>
</pre>
They both correspond to the addressof, `&', operator in C, but since
there is no further information about the type of the object you need
to have two depending on if it is a function or a variable you need
the address of.
<p>
The `ccall' construct does in fact unsuger to an invocation of the
ccallCU function.
<pre>
  ccallCU :: CPointer -> [CUnion] -> CUnion -> IO CUnion
</pre>
The first argument is the function to call, the list is the arguments
to the call, the <tt>CUnion</tt> is just used to indicate the return
type of the function call.

<p>
<b>Note</b> To be able to use `_' as the leading character in
identifiers you need to compile with the <tt>-no-pedantic</tt> flag.
<p>
There are a number of C functions available to call for manipulating C
pointers (very unsafe, of course).
<pre>
  Int derefChar (p) char  *p; { return *p; }
  Int derefShort(p) short *p; { return *p; }
  Int derefInt  (p) int   *p; { return *p; }
  Int derefLong (p) long  *p; { return *p; }
  Int derefUChar (p) unsigned char  *p; { return *p; }
  Int derefUShort(p) unsigned short *p; { return *p; }
  Int derefUInt  (p) unsigned int   *p; { return *p; }
  Int derefULong (p) unsigned long  *p; { return *p; }
  double derefFloat (p) float *p; { return *p; }
  double derefDouble (p) double *p; { return *p; }
  void setChar (p, x) char  *p; Int x; { *p = x; }
  void setShort(p, x) short *p; Int x; { *p = x; }
  void setInt  (p, x) int   *p; Int x; { *p = x; }
  void setLong (p, x) long  *p; Int x; { *p = x; }
  void setFloat (p, x) float  *p; double x; { *p = x; }
  void setDouble (p, x) double  *p; double x; { *p = x; }
  Int identity(x) Int x; { return x; }
</pre>

<hr>
To execute an IO action someplace else than at the top level there is
a function
<pre>
  unsafePerformIO :: IO a -> a
</pre>
To get access to it you must import the module
<tt>UnsafePerformIO</tt>.
<p>
<b>Using this function can break referential transparency and it is
generally unsafe.  Use with care, or preferably, not at all.</b>
