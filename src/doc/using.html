<h1>Using the hbc compiler</h1>

The hbc command can be used to compile a module or link compiled
module together.

<h3>On names, files, and modules</h3>
The Haskell report does not specify how Haskell modules, files etc.
should be treated by the compilation system.  Hbc takes a very simple
approach, each file should contain exactly one module and the name of
the file should be the same as the module name with the extension
``.hs'' added.  When such a file is compiled by hbc an interface file
and an object file are produced.  The interface file has the same name
as the source file, but with the extension ``.hi'' instead of ``.hs'',
the object file has the ``.o'' extension.  If the file extension is
``.lhs'' the module is assumed to be on ``literate'' form and is
compiled accordingly.
<p>

When compiling an ``<tt>import</tt>'' declaration the compiler needs to
consult the interface file for the imported module.  To find the
interface file the compiler looks for the module name extended with
``.hi'' in the <em>include path</em>.  The include path is a colon
separated list of directories that are searched in order for the
imported files.  The include path can be set in several ways.
The default value is ``<tt>.:$HBCDIR/hbc_library</tt>'', where
<tt>$HBCDIR</tt> is the value of the <tt>HBCDIR</tt> environment variable (which
defaults to <tt>/usr/local/lib/lmlc</tt> if not set).
If the environment variable <tt>HBCINCPATH</tt> is set this will be taken
as the value of the include path instead.
After this initial value of the include path has been established it
can also be altered by the ``-i'' flag on the command line.  Just 
``-i'' flag will empty the include path.
A ``-i<i>path</i>'' will prepend <i>path</i> to the include path.
<p>

The include path is also used during linking.  All files named
``lib.a'' (or ``lib_p.a'' or ``lib_ph.a'' if the ``-p'' respective ``-ph''
flags have been used)
in the directories in the include path will be given to the
linker.  This means that a directory in the include path should
contain (at least) a number of interface files, and the corresponding
object files in an archive called ``lib.a''.
<p>

The interactive system uses the same mechanism for its <tt>import</tt> command.
But for this to work properly the directories in the include path
should also contain the object files for each of the interface files,
since hbi cannot (yet) use archives.

<h3>Example</h3>
If the file ``Main.hs'' contains
<pre>
  main = putStr (hello "world" ++ "\n")

  hello s = "hello, " ++ s
</pre>
then it can be compiled with the command
<pre>
  hbc Main.hs -o hello
</pre>
This gives an executable file called ``hello''.
