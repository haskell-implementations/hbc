<h1>Declarations and Bindings</h1>

Data type declarations can specify that certain type variables are to
be universally or existentially quantified.  This extension is turned
on with the <tt>-flocal-quant</tt> flag.
<h3>Universal</h3>
Universal quantification is indicated by having free type variables on
the right hand side of a <tt>data</tt> (<tt>newtype</tt>) declaration.
<p>
Example:
<pre>
  data IdFun = IdCon (a -> a)
</pre>
Here <tt>IdCon</tt> can only be applied to values which
have type <i>for all a.a->a</i>.  This means that the application
"<tt>IdCon id</tt>" is type correct, whereas "<tt>IdCon negate</tt>"
is <b>wrong</b> since <tt>negate</tt> does not have type <tt>a->a</tt>
for all <tt>a</tt>.
<p>
When such a value is deconstructed (in pattern matching) it regains
its universal quantification.
Type correct example:
<pre>
  f (IdCon g) = (g 'a', g True)
</pre>
Notice how g is applied to arguments of different types; this is
normally not possible with lambda bound variables.
<p>
A universally quantified type variable can have a context as well, e.g.
<pre>
  data NumOps = (Num a) => NumOps { square :: a->a, cube :: a->a }
  numOps = NumOps { square = \x->x*x, cube = \x->x*x*x }
  f :: (Num a) => NumOps -> a -> a
  f (NumOps { square, cube }) x = cube (square x)
</pre>
<h3>Existential</h3>
The type system has been extended with existential types as described
in Konstantin Läufer's thesis.

All type variables that are free and have a name that starts with `?'
in a type definition are considered
to be existentially quantified just before the constructor in which they appear.
Example
<pre>
  data T = C ?a (?a->Int)
</pre>
Here <tt>?a</tt> is free (since it does not appear after <tt>T</tt>) and thus existentially quantified.
When constructing values <tt>C</tt> is polymorphic as usual.
<pre>
  hetl = [C 4 (+1), C [1,2] length, C 3.14 toInt]
</pre>
This list has typing <tt>hetl::[T]</tt>, but is really heterogenous since
the elements have different types.
When a constructor with a existentially quantified type is used
in pattern matching it
behaves differently.  The actual type of the quantified variable
is not allowed to escape outside the expression tied to the pattern matching.

The following function is allowed
<pre>
  f c = 
      case c of 
         C v f -> f v 
</pre>
since it has typing <tt>f::T->Int</tt>, but not this
<pre>
  g c = 
      case c of 
         C x y -> x 
</pre>
since the actual type of <tt>x</tt> is not known.

Existentially quantified variables can also be constrained by giving
a context before a constructor.  The following defines a type where the
argument to the constructor has to have a type belonging to class <tt>Show</tt>.
<pre>
  data TShow = (Show ?a) => T ?a
</pre>
This can be used as follows:
<pre>
  l :: [TShow]
  l = [T True, T 1, T (atan 1), T [True]] 
  s = map show l
</pre>
and the value of <tt>s</tt> will be <tt>["True","1","7.8539816339744828e-1","[True]"]</tt>.
<p>
The automatic derivation of instance declarations does not work for
types containing existentially quantified variables.
<p>
<b>NOTE</b> The current implementation does not allow mixing universal
and existential quantification within a single constructor.  As soon
as one type variable starts with a `?' all free type variables are
considered to be existential.
<p>
<hr>
<p>
The restrictions on instance declarations are relaxed if the flag
<tt>-no-pedantic</tt>.
Normally instance declarations can have the form
<pre>
  instance K => C (T a<sub>1</sub> ... a<sub>n</sub>)
</pre>
where a<sub>1</sub> ... a<sub>n</sub> are type vars.
With the flags they can be of the form
<pre>
  instance K => C (T t<sub>1</sub> ... t<sub>n</sub>)
</pre>
where t<sub>1</sub> ... t<sub>n</sub> are arbitrary type expressions.
If more than one instance declaration can be used to resolve an overloading
the following rule is used:
<blockquote>
  If there is a single most specific declaration (in the usual type
  specialisation ordering) then this is used, otherwise an ambiguity
  error is reported.
</blockquote>
This means that you can make declarations like
<pre>
  instance Eq [Char] where ...
</pre>
and make a special purpose fast comparison routine for strings and
get this whenever strings are compared.  So far this has not been
used anywhere in the Prelude, but a faster version of Ratio Integer
(coded in C) will probably be included in a future version.
<p>
This is a dubious feature and should not be used carelessly.
<p>

<hr>
Instance declarations cannot contain pattern bindings.
<p>
<hr>
Instance declarations are not exported exactly as the Haskell standard
says, instead of always being exported they are only exported if the
type and/or the class are exported.  The Haskell behaviour can be
gotten by <tt>-fno-inst-with-c-t</tt>.

<p>
<hr>
In Hugs 1.3 you will not get an Eval instance if a <tt>newtype</tt>
does not admit it.  E.g.
<blockquote>
  newtype T f = T (f Int)
</blockquote>
You can get a similar behaviour from hbc by specifying the
<tt>-fno-bad-eval-inst</tt> flag.
<p>
<hr>
Type synonyms defined in hbc can only have kind *, so this definition
<blockquote>
  type List = []
</blockquote>
is legal Haskell 1.4, but not possible in hbc.  Use
<blockquote>
  type List a = [a]
</blockquote>
instead.
