<h1>Expressions</h1>

A parser problem sometimes forces the type after <tt>::</tt> to be
enclosed in parenthesis.
<hr>
The parsing of expressions with operators that are neither left- not right-assocative is somewhat
different.  They may occur in an expression with associative operators of the same precedence
without an error.
