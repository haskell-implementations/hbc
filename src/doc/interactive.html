<h1>The HBI interactive system</h1>

<h3>Using hbi</h3>
The interactive system can load both source
files and compiled files.  Functions defined with the interactive
system runs 10 -- 50 times slower than compiled code; compiled code
called from interactive use runs at full speed.
<p>
The system is started by
<pre>
  hbi
</pre>
and you will then be greeted by (something like)
<pre>
Welcome to interactive Haskell B. 1.4 version 0.9999.4 Pentium 1997 Feb 12!
Loading prelude... 1457 values, 199 types found.
Type "help;" to get help.
> 
</pre>
<p>
The interactive version of Haskell B uses dynamic loading of object files,
since this is rather complicated for some machines it has not been
implemented for all platforms yet.

<h3>Commands</h3>
The first prompt is ``<tt>></tt>'' and any subsequent prompts until a command
is completed will be ``<tt>#</tt>''.
The following commands are available (note that they all end with semicolon):
<ul>
  <li> <var>expression</var><tt>;</tt><br>
      Evaluate and print the expression (more on printing below).

  <li> <tt>let </tt><var>decl</var><tt>;</tt></br>
      Make the bindings in <var>decl</var> and make them available in
      the rest of the session.  No evaluation of the bound objects
      is performed.  The usual offside rule applies here.

  <li> <var>ident</var><tt> &lt;- </tt><var>expression</var><tt>;</tt><br>
      The expression must be of type <tt>IO t</tt>.  The I/O action is
      performed and the identifier gets the resulting value.

  <li> <var>topdecl</var><tt>;</tt><br>
      Any top level declaration except <var>decl</var>.

  <li> <tt>load "</tt><var>file</var><tt>";</tt><br>
      Load a file.  The string specifies what should be loaded, it can have
      three forms:
      <ul>
	<li> *.hs<br>
	load a .hs file.  This must be an ordinary Haskell B module.
	<li> *.o<br>
	load .o and .hi files.  These files must be produced
	by compiling an ordinary Haskell B module with hbc.
	<li> *<br>
	loads *.hs if it is newer than *.o, otherwise the *.o file.
      </ul>

  <li> <tt>import </tt><var>moduleid</var><tt>;</tt><br>
      Load a .o file using the $HBCINCPATH, used to load library stuff.

  <li> <tt>source "</tt><var>file</var><tt>";</tt><br>
      Read commands from the given file.

  <li> <tt>whatis </tt><var>ident</var><tt>;</tt><br>
      Give information about the identifier <var>ident</var>.

  <li> <tt>help;</tt><br>
      Print some information about hbi.

  <li> <tt>quit;</tt><br>
      Quit the system.
</ul>

The defaults for numeric types are <tt>Integer</tt> and <tt>Double</tt>
instead of <tt>Int</tt> and <tt>Double</tt> in the compiler.
(This is nicer when hbi is used as a calculator.)
<p>

It is possible to interrupt the evalution of an expression by hitting
the interrupt key.
If the program does not stop after the first at first try, then wait a little and try again.
The first only interrupts the program at certain well defined places
and is less dangerous.  The second stops the program anywhere except in
garbage collection.
<p>

There is an tcsh/Emacs like command line editing available.
<p>

The system catches most errors and prints an appropriate message.
Unfortunately some errors, like stack overflow, may be uncaught and
the system just dies.
<p>

<h3>Printing</h3>
If the value to be printed is of type <tt>IO ()</tt> the I/O action is
performed and nothing is printed.  If it is of type <tt>IO t</tt> the
I/O action is performed and the resulting value is printed by first
applying <tt>show</tt> to it.  All other values are printed by
applying <tt>show</tt> and printing the resulting string.
<p>

During garbage collection the string `` GC '' will occur on the output.

<h3>Shared object loading</h3>

On some systems, hbi cannot load object code from .o files, but use
<i>shared objects</i> (.so files) instead. When loading or importing
files compiled by the user, hbi will automatically build and use such
shared objects. On these systems, hbi will also look for shared
libraries named <tt>lib_i.so</tt> or <tt>lib.so</tt> in $HBCINCPATH
when importing library modules.
<p>

On systems which allow both normal and shared object loading, hbi
defaults to normal loading. Shared object loading can then be achieved
by starting hbi with ``-s''.

<h3>Compiling with hbc for use by hbi</h3>

If shared object loading is used, compile with the flag ``-fno-zap-redex''.
