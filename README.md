## HaskellWiki commentary

The Chalmers Haskell-B compiler 0.9999.5c implements Haskell 98, as
well as some extensions. It is written by Lennart Augustsson, and
based on the classic LML compiler by Augustsson and Johnsson. The
interpreter can also load code compiled with HBC. There has been no
official release for the last few years and the support level is
pretty low, but the compiler exists and can be used.
